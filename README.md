# Landing Page Project
This is the first project in Udacity's Front End Web Development Professional Nanodegree Program (egfwd Initiative).

## Landing Page Behavior

* Navigation: Navigation is built dynamically as an unordered list.

* Section Active State: It should be clear which section is being viewed while scrolling through the page.

* Scroll to Anchor: When clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link should scroll to the appropriate section.
